## Just the beginning

- Means, medians, and MAD are just a few examples of _numerical summaries_.
- In this lab, we will learn how to calculate and interpret additional summaries of  distributions such as: minimums, maximums, ranges, quartiles and IQRs. 
    - We'll also learn how to write our first custom function!
- Start by loading your _Personality Color_ data again and name it `colors`.


## Extreme values

- Besides looking at _typical_ values, sometimes we want to see _extreme_ values, like the smallest and largest values.
    - To find these values, we can use the `min`, `max` or `range` functions. These functions use a similar syntax as the `mean` function.
- **(1) Find and write down the `min` value and `max` value for your predominant color.**
- **(2) Apply the `range` function to your predominant color and describe the output.**
    - The _range_ of a variable is the difference between a variable's smallest and largest value. 
    - Notice, however, that our `range` function calculates the maximum and minimum values for a variable, but not the difference between them.
    - Later in this lab you will create a custom `Range` function that will calculate the difference.

## Quartiles (Q1 & Q3)

- The <b>median</b> of our data is the value that splits our data in half.
    - Half of our data is smaller than the _median_, half is larger.
- _Q1_ and _Q3_ are similar.
    - 25% of our data are smaller than _Q1_, 75% are larger.
    - 75% of our data are smaller than _Q3_, 25% are larger.
    
- **(3) Fill in the blanks to compute the value of _Q1_ for your predominant color.**
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
quantile(~____, data = ____, p = 0.25)
```

- **(4) Use a similar line of code to calculate and write down _Q3_, which is the value that's larger than 75% of our data.**

## The Inter-Quartile-Range (IQR)

- **(5) Write and run code making a `dotPlot` of your _predominant_ color's scores. Make sure to include the `nint` option.**
- Visually (don't worry about being super-precise): 
    - <span class="blue">Cut the distribution into quarters so the _number_ of _data points_ is equal for each piece. (Each piece should contain 25% of the data.)</span>
      - Hint: You might consider using the `add_line(vline =  )` to add vertical lines at the quarter marks.
    - **(6) Write down the numbers that split the data up into these 4 pieces.**
    - **(7) How long is the interval of the middle two pieces?**
    - This length is the <b>IQR</b>.


## Calculating the IQR

- The `IQR` is another way to describe _spread_.
    - It describes how _wide_ or _narrow_ the middle 50% of our data are.
- Just like we used the `min` and `max` to compute the `range`, we can also use the _1st_ and _3rd_ quartiles to compute the _IQR_.
- **(8) Use the values of _Q1_ and _Q3_ you calculated previously for your predominant color and find the _IQR_ by hand**.
    - **(9) Then write and run code using the `iqr()` function to calculate it for you.**
- **(10) Which personality color score has the widest spread according to the _IQR_? Which is narrowest?**

## Boxplots

- By using the medians, quartiles, and min/max, we can construct a new single variable plot called the <b>box and whisker</b> plot, often shortened to just <b>boxplot</b>.
- **(11) By showing someone a `dotPlot`, how would you teach them to make a _boxplot_? Write out your explanation in a series of steps for the person to use.**
    - **(12) Use the steps you write to create a sketch of a _boxplot_ for your predominant color's scores in your journal.**
    - **(13) Then write and run code using the `bwplot` function to create a _boxplot_ using `R`.**
    
## Our favorite summaries

- In the past two labs, we've learned how to calculate numerous _numerical summaries_.
    - Computing lots of different summaries can be tedious.
- **(14) Fill in the blanks below to compute some of our _favorite_ summaries for your predominant color all at once.**
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
favstats(~____, data = colors)
```

## Calculating a range value

- We saw in a previous slide that the `range` function calculates the maximum and minimum values for a variable, but not the difference between them.
- We could calulate this difference in two steps:
  - Step 1: Use the `range` function to `assign` the max and min values of a variable the name `values`. This will store the output from the `range` function in the _Environment_ pane.
    
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
values <- range(~____, data = colors)
```

  - Step 2: Use the `diff` function to calculate the difference of `values`. The input for the `diff` function needs to be a vector containig two numeric values.

    
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
diff(values)
```
- **(15) Use these two steps to calculate and write down the _range_ of your predominant color.**


## Introducing custom functions 

- Calculating the _range_ of many variables can be tedious if we have to keep performing the same two steps over and over.
    - We can combine these two steps into one by writing our own custom `function`.
- Custom functions can be used to combine a task that would normally take many steps to compute and simplify them into one.
- The next slide shows an example of how we can create a custom function called `mm_diff` to calculate the absolute difference between the `mean` and `median` value of a `variable` in our `data`.


## Example function

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
mm_diff <- function(variable, data) {
  mean_val <- mean(variable, data = data)
  med_val <- median(variable, data = data)
  abs(mean_val - med_val)
}
```

- The function takes two _generic_ arguments: `variable` and `data`.
- It then follows the steps between the curly braces `{}`.
    - Each of the _generic_ arguments is used inside the `mean` and `median` functions.
- <span class="blue">Copy and paste the code above into an _R Script_ and _run_ it. </span>
- The `mm_diff` function will appear in your _Environment_ pane.


## Using mm_diff()

- After running the code used to create the function, we can use it just like we would any other numerical summary.
    - **(16) In the _console_, fill in the blanks below to calculate the absolute difference between the `mean` and `median` values of your predominant color:**
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
____(~____, data = ____)
```

- **(17) Which of the four colors has the largest absolute difference between the `mean` and `median` values?**
    - **(18) By examining a `dotPlot` for this personality color, make an argument why either the `mean` or `median` would be the better description of the _center_ of the data.**


## Our first function

- **(19) Using the previous example as a guide, write a function called `Range` (note the capital 'R') that calculates the _range_ of a variable by filling in the blanks below:**

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
____ <- function (____, ____) {
  values <- range(____, data = ____)
  diff(___)
}
```

- **(20) Use the `Range` function to find the personality color with the largest difference between the `max` and `min` values.**


## On your own

- **(21) Write a function called `myIQR` that uses the `quantile` function to compute the middle 30% of the data.**
