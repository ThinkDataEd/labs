## Whose data? Our data.

- Throughout the previous labs, we've been using data that was already loaded in RStudio.
    - But what if we want to analyze our own data?
- This lab is all about learning how to load our own Participatory Sensing data into RStudio.


## Export, upload, import

- Before we can perform any analysis, we have to load data into `R`. 
- When we want to get our Participatory Sensing data into RStudio, we:
  - <font color="green">Export</font> the data from your class's campaign page.
  - <font color="green">Upload</font> data to _RStudio_ server.
  - <font color="green">Import</font> the data into `R`'s working memory.
  
    - *NOTE: You can watch the following video for a step-by-step walk-through of the process:*

## Exporting

- <span class="blue">To begin, go to the IDS Tools page.</span>
  - <span class="blue">Click on the <font color="green">Campaign Manager</font>.</span>
  - <span class="blue">Fill in your username and password and click "Sign in".</span>
<center>![Campaign Manager](images/campaign_manager.png){ style="max-height: 40vh; max-width: 80%;" }</center>

If you forget your username or password, ask your teacher to remind you. 


## Campaign Manager

<center>![Campaign Manager](images/campaign_manager1.png){ width=90% }</center>

- After logging in, your screen should look similar to this.
- <span class="blue">Click on the dropdown arrow for the campaign you are interested in downloading.</span>
  - At this point in the course, it will most likely be the Food Habits campaign.


## Dropdown Arrow

- The options for the dropdown menu will look like this: 
<center>![Campaign Tab](images/dropdown.png){ style="max-height: 50vh; max-width: 30%;" }</center>
- <span class="blue">Click on the option labeled <font color="green">Export Data</font>.</span>
  - Remember where you save your file!


## Exporting

- When you clicked the <font color="green">Export</font> link, a _.csv_ file was saved on your computer.
- Now that the file is on your computer, we need to <font color="green">upload</font> it into RStudio.


## Uploading

- <span class="blue">Look at the four different _panes_ in RStudio.</span>
  - <span class="blue">Find the _pane_ with a <font color="green">Files</font> tab.</span>
  - <span class="blue">Click it!</span>

<center> ![Upload Button](images/FilesPane.png){ width=50% } </center>

- <span class="blue">Click the button on the Files pane that says "Upload".</span>
  - <span class="blue">Click on "Choose File" and find the _SurveyResponses.csv_ file you saved to your computer.</span>
  - <span class="blue">Hit the _OK_ button.</span>
- Voila!
  - If you look in the <font color="green">Files</font> pane, you should be able to find your data!


## Upload vs. Import

- By <font color="green">Uploading</font> your data into RStudio you've really only given yourself access to it.
  - Don't believe me? Look at the <font color="green">Environment</font> pane ... where's your data?
- To actually use the data we need to <font color="green">Import</font> it into your computer's memory.
- To compute more quickly and efficiently, `R` will only keep a few datasets stored in its memory at a time.
    - By importing data, you are telling `R` that this is a dataset that is important to store it in its memory so you can use it.


## Importing

<center>![Import Data](images/RStudioCloudImport.png){ width=50% }</center>

- <span class="blue">On the Files pane, find the data you want to <font color="green">Import</font>.</span>
- <span class="blue">Click on the name of the file and choose the option "Import Dataset...".</span>


## Data Preview

<center>![Data Preview](images/DataPreview.png){ width=60% }</center>

- You can give your data a name using the <font color="green">Name: </font> field in the lower left corner.


## What's in a name?

- The name you give your data is what you will use when you write code to analyze your data.
    - Good names are short and descriptive. 
    - For your Food Habits campaign, some good names to use would be "foodhabits" or even just "food".
- When you're ready, click the _Import_ button.
- Make sure the name under Import Options matches the name in Code Preview before you click Import.

## read.csv()

- After you click _Import_ you might notice something appeared in your console.
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
data.file <- read_csv("~/SurveyResponse.csv")
View(data.file)
```

- This is the actual code `RStudio` uses to read your data when you clicked the _Import_ button. 
  - So instead of using the `RStudio` buttons, we can actually <font color="green">Import</font> by writing code similar to what was output into the console!
  - This will come in handy later in the course.


## A word on staying organized...

<center> ![Rename Button](images/FilesPane.png){ width=60% }</center>

- The <font color="green">Files</font> tab has a few other features to help keep you organized.
  - _CampaignName - Ids Teacher Year Semester_ probably isn't the best name for your data. Click <font color="green">Rename</font> to give it a clearer name.
  - Often, it's helpful to give your data file the same name as when you import your data.
  - So in this case, we could name our data file _food.csv_.


## Analysis Time

- After you <font color="green">Export</font>, <font color="green">Upload</font>, and <font color="green">Import</font> your data, you're ready to analyze. 
- **(1) `View` your data and select a variable. Write and run a code to create an appropriate plot for that variable.**
- **(2) What variable did you choose? What does the plot tell us about that variable?**
- **Summarize the process: **
  - **(3) What might your future self forget about this process? Summarize the steps you took in this lab to use new data in RStudio.**
