## Building better models

- So far, in the labs, we've learned how to make predictions using the _line of best fit_, also known as _linear models_ or _regression models_.
- We've also learned how to measure our model's prediction accuracy by cross-validation.
- In this lab, we'll investigate the following question:

_Will including more variables in our model improve its predictions?_


## Divide & Conquer

- **(1) Start by loading the `movie` data and write and run code splitting it into two sets (see Lab 4C for help).**
    - <span class="blue">A set named `training` that includes 75% of the data.</span>
    - <span class="blue">A set named `test` that includes the remaining 25%.</span>
    - <span class="blue">Remember to use `set.seed`.</span>
- **(2) Write and run code creating a linear model, using the `training` data, that predicts `gross` using `runtime`.**
    - **(3) Write and run code calculating the MSE of the model by making predictions for the `test` data.**
- **(4) Do you think that a movie's `runtime` is the only factor that goes into how much a movie will make? What else might affect a movie's `gross`?**


## Including more info

- Data scientists often find that including more relevant information in their models leads to better predictions.
    - **(5) Fill in the blanks below to predict `gross` using `runtime` and `reviews_num`.**
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
lm(____ ~ ____ + ____, data = training)
```

- **(6) Does this new model make more or less accurate predictions? Describe the process you used to arrive at your conclusion.**
- **(7) Write down the code you would use to include a 3rd variable, of your choosing, in your `lm()`.**


## On your own

- **(8) Write down which other variables in the `movie` data you think would help you make better predictions.** 
    - **(9) Are there any variables that you think would not improve our predictions?**
- **(10) Write and run code creating a model for all of the variables you think are relevant.**
    - **(11) Assess whether your model makes more accurate predictions for the `test` data than the model that included only `runtime` and `reviews_num`.**
- **(12) With your neighbors, determine which combination of variables leads to the best predictions for the `test` data.**
