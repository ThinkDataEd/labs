## How to make predictions

- Anyone can make predictions.
    - Data scientists use data to inform their predictions by using the information learned from the sample to make predictions for the whole population.
- In this lab, we'll learn how to make predictions by finding the _line of best fit_.
    - You will also learn how to use the information from one variable to make predictions about another variable.


## Predicting heights

- **(1) Write and run code using the `data()` function to load the `arm_span` data.**
- This data comes from a sample of 90 people in the Los Angeles area.
    - The measurements of `height` and `armspan` are in inches.
    - A person's `armspan` is the maximum distance between their fingertips when they spread their arms out wide.
- **(2) Write and run code making a plot of the `height` variable.**
    - **(3) If you had to predict the height of someone in the Los Angeles area, what single height would you choose and why?**
    - **(4) Would you describe this as a _good_ guess? What might you try to improve your predictions?**


## Predicting heights knowing arm spans

- **(5) Write and run code creating two subsets of our `arm_span` data:**
    - One for `armspan >= 61` and `armspan <= 63`. 
    - A second for `armspan >= 64` and `armspan <= 66`.
- **(6) Write and run code creating a `histogram` for the `height` of people in each subset.**
- **Answer the following based on the data:**
    - **(7) What `height` would you predict if you knew a person had an `armspan` around 62 inches?**
    - **(8) What `height` would you predict if you knew a person had an `armspan` around 65 inches?**
    - **(9) Does knowing someone's `armspan` help you predict their `height`? Why or why not?**




<!-- Problems with using the mean -->
<!-- === -->

<!-- - Using `mean` values to make predictions has a few drawbacks which we highlight below: -->
<!-- - Calculate the `mean` `height` of people who have an `armspan` of 69 and 70 inches.  -->
<!--     - **How much taller is the person with a 70 inch `armspan` than the 69 inch `armspan`, on average? Does this seem reasonable?** -->
<!--     - **How tall would you predict someone who had a 69.5 inch `armspan` to be?** -->


## Fitting lines

<!-- - Making predictions using means can lead to drastic jumps in predicted values. -->
<!--     - They also leave us unable to make predictions for inbetween values, like 69.5. -->
<!-- - For these reasons, data scientists often _fit_ lines to their data to make predictions. -->
- Notice that there is a trend that people with a larger `armspan` also tend to have a larger mean `height`.
    - One way of describing this sort of trend is with a line.
- Data scientists often _fit_ lines to their data to make predictions.    
    - What we mean by _fit_ is to come up with a line that's close to as many of the data points as possible.
- **(10) Write and run code creating a scatterplot for `height` and `armspan`. Then run the following code.**
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
add_line()
```

- <span class="blue">On the _Plot_ pane, click two data points to draw a line through.</span>

- NOTE: Watch the following video if you are experiencing difficulties obtaining your line:

- If you are unsuccessful using the `add_line()` function, refer to the next slide to learn how to use the `get_line()` function.

## get_line()

- The `get_line()` function does not rely on clicking on the scatterplot to choose points, but rather on you providing the points manually. 

- For example, let's say you want to obtain the equation of the line that passes through the points (59,60) and (68,67). This is how you would use the `get_line` function:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
get_line(c(59,60), c(68,67))
```

- Notice the output is the y-intercept and slope of your line.
- Now you can use the `add_line()` function to include the line in your scatterplot.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
add_line(intercept = 14.1111111, slope = 0.7777778)
```

- If your line doesn't quite fit the way you want it, try another ordered pair or make modifications to the existing equation.

## Predicting with lines

- **(11) Draw a line that you think is a good _fit_ and write down its equation. Using this equation:**
    - **(12) Predict how tall a person with a 62-inch `armspan` and a person with a 65-inch `armspan` would be.**
    
<!-- - **How much taller is the person with a 70 inch `armspan` than the 69 inch `armspan`? Does this difference seem more reasonable than the difference we calculated using the means?**   -->
- Using a line to make predictions also lets us make predictions for `armspan`s that aren't in our data.
    - **(13) How tall would you predict a person with a 63.5-inch `armspan` to be?**
- **(14) Compare your answers with a neighbor. Did both of you come up with the same equation for a line? If not, can you tell which line fits the data best?**
